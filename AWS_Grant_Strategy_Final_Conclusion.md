## Final Conclusion

**HYBRID ACCOUNT STRATEGY now represents our most cost-effective path to securing AWS credits, avoiding expensive migration while maximizing credit opportunities.**

The migration cost analysis reveals that full infrastructure migration ($7,950-8,500) is not financially viable for the likely credit amounts from new account applications ($1,000 self-service tier). However, a hybrid approach provides the best balance of cost-effectiveness and credit opportunity.

**REVISED IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Create new business AWS account within 24 hours**
2. **Apply for AWS Activate direct programs with new account (target $1,000)**
3. **Apply to NVIDIA Inception Program with existing account (target $10,000-$25,000)**
4. **Deploy NEW projects/features to new account to utilize credits**
5. **Maintain existing production infrastructure on current account (061051241666)**
6. **Document all applications and outcomes for future reference**

This hybrid strategy acknowledges both the migration cost reality and the documented rejection patterns while providing multiple pathways to credits without expensive infrastructure migration.

**Key Strategic Shift**: From "migration necessity" to "hybrid optimization" based on cost-benefit analysis.
